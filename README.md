# Quantum_Haar_Wavelet_Transform_Qiskit

This is a project to simulate the quantum Haar wavelet transform using IBM's Qiskit framework, as well as to execute the circuit on an actual quantum backend.

## Abstract

Historically, multi-resolution analysis based on wavelets was developed to extract information about the time-frequency representation of a signal. Inability to do so is a shortcoming of the widely used Fourier transform, and wavelets provide information as to which spectral component occurs at what time. Thus, wavalets, including the Haar wavelet transform, have become very important for data compression, noise analysis etc. On the other hand, The quantum analogue of the Fourier transform has been found to be extremely useful in algorithms like Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to study the quantum Haar wavelet transform as well, for potentially ground-breaking applications. Here, we make a study of this transform, and perform noiseless and noisy simulations using IBM Q based on efficient circuits proposed in literature, and also execute the circuit on an actual quantum backend.
